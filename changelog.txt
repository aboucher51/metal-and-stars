Version: 0.0.5
Date: 01.20.2025
  Changes:
    - added support for nuclear science mod
    - quantum science pack no longer spoils. It was a nice idea, but unoptimizable with how spoilage works
    - added repeatable research for module creation productivity
  Bugfixes:
    - conduit can be built on Neumann again
    - added liquid rocket fuel to rocket fuel productivity research
    - added recipe to actually use uranium-233
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.4
Date: 01.19.2025
  Changes:
    - antimatter statistic increased by 10x to .001
    - added a (small) fuel value to light oil and heavy oil
    - added mirandite sludge to asteroid productivity
    - added recipe for wood to carbon in pyrolysis tech
    - added a chest usable in space conditions, attached to the nanite milestone track
  Bugfixes:
    - research prerequisite changes that make sense for certain recipes
    - mirandite changed to use dramatically less material
    - the advanced thruster fuel and advanced thruster oxidizer recipes should now be affected by the repeatable research
    - mirandite chunks should behave like asteroid chunks now
    - more localization strings
    - several planetary properties were adjusted. Notably, Neumann should be functionally similar to an space platform
    - better support for Enemy Race Manager mod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
Date: 01.18.2025
  Changes:
    - added some spaceroutes that made sense
    - added compatibility with maraxsis and tenebris
    - added module slots to barometric vice, gravity assembler
  Bugfixes:
    - fixed bug caused when Enemy Race Manager is present
    - added some more localized strings. Better descriptions coming soon.
    - nanite rocket parts should only be buildable on Neumann
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.2
Date: 01.18.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - changed load order for armored biter addendum
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
