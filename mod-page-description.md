## There's more than one way to leave the solar system
4 new space locations, each with their own science pack. A serenely derelict space platform, an artificial ringworld that's been overtaken by opposing forces, a dark and frozen world with mixed resources, and a debris field with phase-changing asteroids. You can access this solar subsystem as soon as you leave nauvis.

## Project Goal
I wanted to make more planets that each met the criteria and approximate difficulty of the original 3 new planets.

- mostly self-sufficient
- unique resources, science, machines, and technologies
- processes that felt sufficiently different from planets
- a unique manufacturing niche
- a unique aesthetic and fantasy


## New Technologies
#### Research for
- better robots
- better ammunition
- improved fuels
- alternative recipes
- resource conversion
- improved rocket part recipes

#### Infinite Research for
- ammo productivity
- space fuel productivity
- planetary resource productivity

#### and plenty more

## Neumann V
Neumann was a giant space platform that's been abandoned, and it shows. It's crawling with nanite fluid - probably both why it's in such bad shape and why it's even held together at all. With nanite construction, parts are cheap here, and combined with calm asteroid activity, this is a great place to build space platforms.


## Nix
Nix is a frozen world like Aquilo, and has long dark nights. Unlike Aquilo though, it's bursting with resources. Most of the resources are mixed in pairs like icy crude oil, or iron+copper deposits. It's also home to a paradoxical type of matter which can be compressed into a flexible energy additive. Keep the factory warm any way you like, including with the new liquid fuel heating tower. That said, it's an easier time if you research Nuclear Power before coming - you'll eventually be able to produce reactor fuel from local resources


## Circa
Circa is a ringworld, a constructed satellite halo built to rotate around a cooler star. it's much wider than it is tall, and it's always daytime on a ringworld (so no need for accumulators here) The left and right of spawn have distrinctly different environments. The left side is overgrown, and has armored snapper enemies. It's also where you can turn tar into oil, and where you'll find all the water on the planet. The right side is a desert, with gold-flaked sands and scattered military scrap guarded by flying robots that have since turned hostile. This is similar to a ribbonworld, and a great idea is to run a train track along the length of it.


## Mirandus
Mirandus is a shattered astral body with no surface. Instead, it's surrounded by asteroids made of the planet's old mineral, mirandite. You turn this into a sludge to extract trace minerals including quantite. Quantite phase shifts (spoils), looping through 3 states. After researching it, you can also use quantite to turn certain resources into others, among other uses.


### Mod compatibility
No explicit compatibility has been added, but I'm happy to work with anyone who's interested.
This mod modifies very little from vanilla, removes nothing, and depends on several graphics and entities from both the base game and space_age.
