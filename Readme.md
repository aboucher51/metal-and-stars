### Goals
- less restrictions on *where* you do things.
- more options to do similar, common tasks (ie: rocket parts)
- interesting new recipe puzzles
- a shipyard "home" station. Nauvis shouldn't feel like "home" anymore
- more T1 planets. More T2 planets. Not all planets needed to reach the edge of space.
- each planet should follow the template laid down by the base game
    - there should be a unique challenge to each planet, and ideally a planetary mechanic
    - there should be a (nearly) immediate prize to starting a planet
    - there should be a science pack exclusive to that planet that leads to more rewards
    - planets should have desirable exports
    - T1 planets shouldn't *need* to import anything critical to launching a rocket
    - reaching T1 requires physical, T2 requires explosive, and solar edge requires burst-physical damage
- Recipe structuring
    - except water, recipes should avoid liquid surplus
- Minimize modifying the base game when possible, especially
    - technologies
    - recipes
    - removing resources
- Avoid disempowering players
- Design with colorblindness in mind
